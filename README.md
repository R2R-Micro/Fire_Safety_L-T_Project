Project Aim: Industrial Fire Safety System
Problem Statement: Develop a prototype system which can generate and evacuate the workers under fire accident.

Scope of the Solution: 
The scope of this prototype solution is to develop an integrated industrial fire safety system capable of:

1) Early and accurate fire detection using a multi-sensor approach.

2) Automated and rapid alarm generation with multi-modal communication (audible, visual, digital, mobile notifications).

3) Intelligent worker evacuation management through dynamic route guidance, real-time occupancy tracking, and automated access control of emergency exits.

4) Providing a foundational platform for real-time monitoring, incident logging, and post-event analysis to enhance overall industrial safety protocols.

This prototype focuses on the immediate life-safety aspects during a fire accident, aiming to minimize response time and optimize evacuation efficiency. It does not encompass fire suppression systems (e.g., sprinklers, CO2 systems) or extensive post-fire damage assessment and recovery, though it can be integrated with such systems in a full-scale deployment. The system prioritizes human safety through proactive detection and guided evacuation.

Required Components:
1) MQ2 Sensor
2) Flame Sensor
3) Arduino Uno
4) Breadboard
5) Jumper Wires
6) Resistor- 220 ohm
7) LED light (Red)
8) Buzzer
9) USB Cable

Software Required: 
1) Arduino IDE
2) TinkerCad
